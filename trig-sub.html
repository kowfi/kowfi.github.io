let: a = constant, x = function
     a cannot be in the Vertical Length/Opposite
First case: &radic;(a²-x²)
<b> a²+(-<s>x</s>)²+<s>x</s>²=a² </b>
           ● "isolated one is the Hypotenuse"
● Following the conditions, 'a' can only be in the hypotenuse.
● Since a comes first, the function is in Adjacent.
      ● leaving x in the Opposite
