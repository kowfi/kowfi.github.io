let: a = constant, x = function
     a cannot be in the Vertical Length/Opposite
First case: &radic;(a²-x²)
a²+(-<s>x</s>)²+<s>x</s>²=a²
            "isolated one is the Hypotenuse"
Following the conditions, 'a' can only be in the hypotenuse.
Since a comes first, the function is in Adjacent.
     leaving x in the Opposite
